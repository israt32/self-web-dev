        <p>
          You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But
          nobody pays me a dime for that work. That's why I am learning and
          mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web
          Development Hero.

            I am the master of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I know everything
            needed to make a website function, efficient. I didn't stop with the
            web. I went beyond with most popular JavaScript framework called Vue
            JS. I even know the deplooyment, server and security. I will give
            you 100% web solution.

            They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remote web
            developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked
            it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming
            Hero.
